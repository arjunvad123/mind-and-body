Experiment 5: Low-Level Transformer Observer

A small observer transformer watches GPT-2's internal activations
token-by-token, layer-by-layer, trained purely on prediction.
Then we probe for emergent consciousness-like properties.

This is the difference between observing someone's behavior
vs observing their brain activity.
