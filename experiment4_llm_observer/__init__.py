Experiment 4: LLM Executor-Observer

Tests the Observer Hypothesis using state-of-the-art language models.
A Claude executor solves coding tasks while a Claude observer watches
the state stream (messages, tool calls, results) with strictly one-way
information flow. We then probe the observer for consciousness markers:
self-models, confabulation, surprise, preferences, and first-thought accuracy.
